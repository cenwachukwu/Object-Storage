# Object Storage

_the storage of the internet_

## How can we define object storage

Organizations create and analyze large volumes of flat or unstructured data such as photos, videos, web pages, etc.. We use Object storage as a means to store and manage these forms of data. That's why it's called the storage of the internet.

This form of cloud storage is ideal for building applications that require scale and flexibility. Object storage can also be used to import existing data stores for analytics, backup, or as an archive.

AWS defines their Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
